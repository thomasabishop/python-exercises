This time you still calculate the total in the previous way but there is an additional step.

You need to read the second character which determines how the round needs to end.

X = you need to lose
Y = you need to drawer
Z = you need to win

Depending on the move of the opponent you must derive what you should play in response in order to meet the specified ending.
