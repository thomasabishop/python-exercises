Take a string of letter characters such as `vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp`.

Split it in half. 

In the example the string has a length of 24, so each half will be 12 characters long:
    -   vJrwpWtwJgWr
    -   hcsFMMfFFhFp

Identify the character(s) that occur in both halves. (There could be more than one character that exists in both.)

In the example there is only one this is `p`. 

Each letter has a "priority weighting":
    -   chars a - z have a priority 1 through 26
    -   chars A - Z have a priority 27 through 52

For each line of input find the sum of the repeating characters and then sum to find the overall total.
